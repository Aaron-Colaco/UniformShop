Adapted from my previous Gift Market project into a click-and-collect uniform shop prototype for my high school. 
I devloped a cart system and integrated the Stripe payment API to manage payments
I integrated Tessaract OCR library to read the information from student IDs and apply restrictions on the type of uniform they can buy based on year level.
